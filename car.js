 * @name CarDatastore.readFileComplete
 * @description
 * Read a CAR archive from a file and return a CarDatastore. The CarDatastore
 * returned will _only_ support read operations: `getRoots()`, `get()`, `has()`
 * and `query()`. Caching makes `get()` and `has()`. This is possible as the entire
 * file is read and decoded before the CarDatastore is returned. mutation
 * operations (`put()`, `delete()` and `setRoots()`) are not available as there
 * is no ability to modify the archive.
 *
 * This create-mode is functionally similar to calling:
 * `CarDatastore.readStreamComplete(fs.createReadStream(path))`
 * However, this create-mode uses raw `fs.read()` operations to seek through
 * the file as required rather than wrapping the consumption in a ReadableStream
 * with its fixed chunk size. This distinction is unlikely to make a difference
 * until a non-buffering `readFile()` create-mode is exposed.
 *
 * Because the entire CAR archive is represented in memory after being parsed,
 * this create-mode is not suitable for large data sets. `readStreaming()`
 * should be used insead for a streaming read supporting only `query()` for an
 * iterative decode.
 *
 * This create-mode is not available in the browser environment.

 * operations (`put()`, `delete()` and `setRoots()`) are not available as there
 * is no ability to modify the archive.

 * The indexing operation uses {@link indexer} to catalogue the contents of the
 * CAR and store a mapping of CID to byte locations for each entry. This method
 * of parsing is not as memory intensive as {@link readStreamComplete} as only
 * the index is stored in memory. When blocks are read, the index tells the
 * reader where to fetch the block from within the CAR file.
 *
 * This mode is suitable for large files where random-access operations are
 * required. Where a full sequential read is only required, use
 * {@link createReadStreaming} which consumes the file in a single pass with no
 * memory used for indexing.

 * entries written directly to the provided stream.
 *
 * Because the roots are encoded in the header of a CAR file, a call to
 * `setRoots()` must be made prior to any `put()` operation. Absent of a

 * CIDs. A call to `setRoots()` after one or more calls to `put()` will result
